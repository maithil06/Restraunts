# Multi-Agent LLM System

Welcome to the **Multi-Agent LLM System**, an innovative AI project where multiple intelligent agents collaborate like a human team to plan, reason, and solve complex tasks autonomously. Powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), this system showcases the future of AI workflows, decision-making, and real-time collaboration.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a multi-agent system where specialized AI agents work together to perform a variety of tasks, from data cleaning to financial analysis. Each agent has a distinct role‚Äîplanners, coders, analysts, and evaluators‚Äîmimicking a human team‚Äôs dynamics. The system is built to handle real-world workflows with a dummy dataset that includes seasonality trends (e.g., busy weekends and holidays).

## ‚ú® Features

- **Grammar Correction & Input Cleaning**: Automatically corrects grammar and standardizes messy inputs.
- **Trend Forecasting**: Analyzes data to forecast trends and models based on seasonality.
- **Transaction Management**: Handles pending, returned, and authorized transactions seamlessly.
- **Labour Cost Calculation**: Computes labour costs across teams with precision.
- **Financial Management**: Generates financial summaries and manages budgets.
- **Collaborative AI Agents**: Agents act as planners, coders, analysts, and evaluators, working together to achieve goals.
- **Gradio Interface**: Interactive UI for easy interaction and visualization of results.

## üìΩÔ∏è Demo

Check out the [demo video](https://github.com/maithil06/Restraunts/blob/main/LLM.mp4) to see the system in action! The demo highlights:
- Agents collaborating to clean and process data.
- Real-time trend analysis and forecasting.
- Financial summaries and transaction handling.
- Labour cost calculations across teams.

## üìä Dataset

The system uses a **dummy dataset** designed to simulate real-world scenarios. Key characteristics:
- **Seasonality Trends**: Reflects busy weekends, holidays, and other periodic patterns.
- **Diverse Data**: Includes transaction records, labour logs, and financial metrics.
- **Scalable**: Easily adaptable for custom datasets.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/multi-agent-llm-system.git
   cd multi-agent-llm-system
